# How to Install:
* First make sure that your `pip` and `virtualenv` versions are up to date. If you don't have `virtualenv`, type `pip install virtualenv`.

* Next, go into the project directory and type `virtualenv venv` to create a virtual environment in a folder called venv.

* Type `source venv/bin/activate` to use the virtual environment instead of your local machine.

* Then type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install package dependencies.

* Finally, to exit the local environment, type `deactivate`.

Make sure to always be in the virtual environment when running the program or have the dependencies installed locally.
